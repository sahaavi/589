## First moment descriptive statistics

Plot Canada Lynx within BC

```{r}
plot(decimalLatitude ~ decimalLongitude,
     pch = 16,
     col = "#046C9A",
     data = lc,
     xlab = "Longtitude",
     ylab = "Latitude",
     main = "Lynx Locations")
```

Visualizing the observation window

```{r}
library(spatstat)
library(sf)
load("datasets/raw/BC_Covariates.Rda")
# Create a SpatialPolygons object for the window
bc_window_sf <- st_as_sf(DATA$Window)
bc_window_owin <- as.owin(bc_window_sf)
# Visualize the window
plot(bc_window_owin, main = "Observation Window")
```

Plot observations in BC window

```{r}
# Convert to a ppp object
lc_ppp <- ppp(x = lc$decimalLongitude, # X coordinates
              y = lc$decimalLatitude, # Y coordinates
              window = bc_window_owin, # Observation window
              )

# Access the rejected points
# attr(lc_ppp, "rejects")

#  Remove rejected/out of window points
lc_ppp <- as.ppp(lc_ppp)

# Plot the ppp object
plot(lc_ppp, 
     pch = 16,
     cex = 0.5,
     cols = "#046C9A",
     main = "Marked Canada Lynx")
```

```{r}
#Get units
unitname(lc_ppp)
```


```{r}
# summary(lc_ppp)
intensity(lc_ppp)
```

### Intensity

```{r}
#Split into a 3 by 3 quadrat and count points
Q <- quadratcount(lc_ppp,
                  nx = 2,
                  ny = 4)
#Plot the output
plot(lc_ppp,
     pch = 16,
     cex = 0.5,
     cols = "#046C9A",
     main = "Lynx locations")

plot(Q, cex = 2, col = "red", add = T)
```

```{r}
#Plot the output Note the use of image = TRUE
plot(intensity(Q, image = T),
     main = "Lynx intensity")

plot(lc_ppp, pch = 16, cex = 0.6, cols = "white", add = T)

plot(lc_ppp, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, cols = "black", add = T)
```

From the above plot it can be seen that the assumption of homogeneity is not appropriate for this dataset as the lynx tend to be clustered in certain areas of the study site, whereas others have no lynx at all. We are further doing quadrat test to verify the inhomogeneity.

Quadrat test of homogeneity

```{r}
quadrat.test(Q)
```

The small p-value suggests that there is a significant deviation from homogeneity. So, the assumption of homogeneity is not met.

### Relationships with covariates

We are usually interested in determining whether the intensity depends on a covariate(s). One simple approach to check for a relationship between inhomogeneous $\lambda(u)$ and a spatial covariate $Z(u)$ is via quadrat counting.

```{r}
# Create 5 elevation classes with equal width
elev_classes <- cut(DATA$Elevation, breaks = 5, labels = c("low", "low-medium", "medium", "high-medium", "high"))
table(elev_classes[lc_ppp])
```

```{r}
library(viridis)
cols = terrain.colors(5)
# Plot the elevation class image and overlay the lynx locations
plot(elev_classes, col = cols, main = "Elevation Classes", par(bg="grey50", cex.main = 2, cex = 0.6))
points(lc_ppp, pch = 16, cex = 0.6, col = "black")
```


```{r}
# Create 5 forest classes with equal width
forest_classes <- cut(DATA$Forest, breaks = 5, labels = c("low", "low-medium", "medium", "high-medium", "high"))
table(forest_classes[lc_ppp])
```

```{r}
# Plot the forest class image and overlay the lynx locations
plot(forest_classes, col = cols, main = "Forest Classes", par(bg="grey50", cex.main = 2, cex = 0.6))
points(lc_ppp, pch = 16, cex = 0.6, col = "black")
```


```{r}
# Create 5 human footprint index classes with equal width
hfi_classes <- cut(DATA$HFI, breaks = 5, labels = c("low", "low-medium", "medium", "high-medium", "high"))
table(hfi_classes[lc_ppp])
```

```{r}
# Plot the human footprint index class image and overlay the lynx locations
plot(hfi_classes, main = "Footprint Index Classes", par(bg="grey50", cex.main = 2, cex = 0.6))
points(lc_ppp, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "white")
```


```{r}
# Create 5 dist water classes with equal width
dist_water_classes <- cut(DATA$Dist_Water, breaks = 5, labels = c("low", "low-medium", "medium", "high-medium", "high"))
table(dist_water_classes[lc_ppp])
```

```{r}
# Plot the dist wanter class image and overlay the lynx locations
plot(dist_water_classes, main = "Dist Water Classes", par(bg="grey50", cex.main = 2, cex = 0.6))
points(lc_ppp, pch = 16, cex = 0.5, col = "white")
```

Based on a visual inspection, it appears that the heterogeneity observed in the data may be associated with a preference for certain elevations and distances from water.

More formally, in testing for relationships with covariates we are assuming that $λ$ is a function of $Z$, such that $$\lambda(u)=\rho(Z(u))$$

A non-parametric estimate of $\rho$ can be obtained via kernel estimation, available via the rhohat() function.

```{r}
#Estimate Rho
rho <- rhohat(lc_ppp, DATA$Elevation)
```

```{r}
plot(rho,
     xlim = c(0,3000),
     xlab = "Elevation",
     main = "Rho vs elevation")
```

There’s a non-linear relationship between elevation and lynx intensity. Majority of the lynx are at low elevations than would be expected by chance, fewer lynx at intermediate elevations and no lynx at high elevations.

```{r}
#Estimate Rho
rho_forest <- rhohat(lc_ppp, DATA$Forest)
```

```{r}
plot(rho_forest,
     #xlim = c(0,3000),
     xlab = "Forest",
     main = "Rho vs Forest")
```

```{r}
#Estimate Rho
rho_water <- rhohat(lc_ppp, DATA$Dist_Water)
```

```{r}
plot(rho_water,
     xlim = c(0,15000),
     xlab = "Water Dist",
     main = "Rho vs Water Dist")
```

```{r}
rho_hfi <- rhohat(lc_ppp, DATA$HFI)
```

```{r}
plot(rho_hfi,
     #xlim = c(0,3000),
     xlab = "Human Footprint Index",
     main = "Rho vs HFI")
```


### Plot on BC Map

```{r}
library(raster)
dmap1 <- density.ppp(lc_ppp, sigma = bw.ppl(lc_ppp),edge=T)
r1 <- raster(dmap1)
```

```{r}
library(leaflet)
#make sure we have right CRS, which in this case is British National Grid

bc_crs <- "+proj=aea +lat_0=45 +lon_0=-126 +lat_1=50 +lat_2=58.5 +x_0=1000000 +y_0=0 +datum=NAD83 +units=m +no_defs"

crs(r1) <- sp::CRS(bc_crs)
```

```{r}
# create a colour palet
pal <- colorNumeric(c("#41B6C4", "red"), values(r1),
  na.color = "transparent")

#and then make map!
leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addRasterImage(r1, colors = pal, opacity = 0.8) %>%
  addLegend(pal = pal, values = values(r1),
    title = "Canada Lynx in BC") 
```



### Nearest neighbour distances

```{r}
col_pal <- colorRampPalette(c('orange', 'green'))
# Calculate nearest neighbor distances
nn_dist <- data.frame(nndist(lc_ppp))
# Add distance to nearest neighbor mark
marks(lc_ppp) <- nn_dist
# Plot point pattern with distance to nearest neighbor mark
plot(lc_ppp, main = "Seperation Distance", 
     which.marks = NULL, 
     cols = col_pal(nrow(nn_dist)), #The colours of the points
     pch = 16)
```

## Second Moment Descriptives

### K-Function

```{r}
# Estimate the k- function
k_lc <- Kest(lc_ppp)
# visualise the results
plot (k_lc, main = "Homogeneous K-Function", lwd = 2)
```

Here we can see that theoretical k-function $k_{pois}(r)$ deviates from other k-function corrections indicates clustering but these estimates assume homogeneity.

```{r}
# Bootstrapped CIs
# rank = 1 means the max and min
# values will be used for CI
E_lc <- envelope(lc_ppp , Kest , rank = 1, nsim = 19, fix.n = T)
# visualise the results
plot (E_lc , main = "Homogeneous K-function")
```

Now we have evidence that suggests significant clustering, but these estimates assume homogeneity.

Relaxing homogeneity assumption.

```{r}
#Estimate intensity
lambda_lc <- density(lc_ppp, bw.ppl)
Kinhom_lc <- Kinhom(lc_ppp, lambda_lc)
# Estimate a strictly positive density
lambda_lc_pos <- density(lc_ppp, sigma=bw.ppl, positive=TRUE)
# Simulation envelope (with points drawn from the estimated intensity)
E_lc_inhom <- envelope(lc_ppp, 
                        Kinhom, 
                        simulate = expression(rpoispp(lambda_lc_pos)), 
                        correction="border", 
                        rank = 1, 
                        nsim = 19, 
                        fix.n = TRUE)
# visualise the results
plot(E_lc_inhom, xlim = c(0,320000), main = "Inhomogeneous K-function", lwd = 2)
```

When correcting for inhomogeneity, the clustering is not as strong homogeneous k-function. Clustering appears to exist in and around 0 to 125000 units.

### Pair Correlation Function

```{r}
#Simulation envelope (with points drawn from the estimated intensity)
pcf_lc_inhom <- envelope(lc_ppp, 
                          pcfinhom, 
                          simulate = expression(rpoispp(lambda_lc_pos)), 
                          rank = 1, 
                          nsim = 19)

# visualise the results
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(pcf_lc_inhom, main = "Inhomogeneous g-function")
# Zoom in on range where significant deviations appear
plot(pcf_lc_inhom, xlim = c(0,20000), main = "", lwd = 2)
```

There appear to be more lynx than expected by random chance between 0 - 13500 as $g(r) > 1$. Beyond that, the locations of lynx appear not to exhibit any significant correlations.

### Collinearity

Collinearity among elevation, forest, human footprint index and water distance.
```{r}
cor.im(DATA$Elevation, DATA$Forest, DATA$HFI, DATA$Dist_Water, use = "complete.obs")
```

The correlation coefficients are relatively weak. We can proceed without too much worry.

## Fit Model

```{r}
# mean centering and scaling the elevation and distance to water variables
mu <- mean(DATA$Elevation)
stdev <- sd(DATA$Elevation)
DATA$Elevation_scaled <- eval.im((Elevation - mu)/stdev, DATA)
mu <- mean(DATA$Dist_Water)
stdev <- sd(DATA$Dist_Water)
DATA$Dist_Water_scaled <- eval.im((Dist_Water - mu)/stdev, DATA)
```


```{r}
fit_1 <- ppm(lc_ppp ~ Elevation_scaled + I(Elevation_scaled^2) + Forest + I(Forest^2) + Dist_Water_scaled + I(Dist_Water_scaled^2) + HFI, data = na.omit(DATA))
fit_1
```

```{r}
quadrat.test(fit_1, nx = 2, ny =4)
```

Significant deviation from model's predictions.

```{r}
# Calculate the residuals
res <- residuals(fit_1)
plot(res,
     cols = "transparent",
     main = "Model Residuals")
```
