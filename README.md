# Canada Lynx Spatial Analysis
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.15468/dl.zeymyk.svg)](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.zeymyk)

This project is aimed at analyzing the spatial patterns of Canada Lynx locations and building a model to predict their location based on environmental covariates. The first and second moment descriptives of the Canada Lynx locations were analyzed to understand the spatial patterns. The model was fitted using the inhomogeneous Poisson process approach to predict the intensity of Canada Lynx locations.
